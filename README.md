# Complete the Coordinate class

1. Add an **eq** method that returns True if coordinates refer to same point in the plane (i.e., have the same x and y coordinate).

2. Define **repr**, a special method that returns a string that looks like a valid Python expression that could be used to recreate an object with the same value. In other words, eval(repr(c)) == c given the definition of **eq** from part 1.
